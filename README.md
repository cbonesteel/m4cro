## About

m4cro is a free web application that helps you pick meals from restaurants
in your local area in order to stay in the confines of your diet. You simply
enter your desired macronutrient counts and our database and connected APIs
will recommend a list of meals from local resteraunts that fit your macros
and give you estimated travel times for pickup.
